      <div>
        <button class="collapsible">How do periods work?</button>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>Around every 23 to 35 days, the uterus develops a lining intended to nourish and protect a fertilized egg (fetus). The fertilized egg must attach itself to the lining in order to grow. When no pregnancy occurs during the cycle, the lining is shed along with nutrients, dissolved remnants of the egg, and tissue such as blood. This is what is known as menstruation, or a period.
<br>
            Basically: no pregnancy = no need for uterine lining = monthly bleeding..</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">How often does menstruation occur?</button>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>Every person’s cycle is different, but the average cycle is between 23-35 days long. A menstrual period starts with the body expelling the old uterine lining as blood. This happens when the egg the ovaries have released isn’t fertilized. The menstrual period ends with the body preparing again to get pregnant by releasing an egg from the ovaries to be fertilized. Menstrual bleeding can last between three to eight days, with the heaviest bleeding occurring during the first few days.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">What happens if someone has an abnormal menstrual cycle?</button>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>When the menstrual cycle occurs over a longer period of time or a person’s bleed is extremely long, heavy, or painful, these can be signs of a medical condition. Common conditions include endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or bleeding disorders, such as Von Willebrand’s disease. If a person bleeds for more than seven days in a row or experiences dizziness, cold extremities, or severe pain, it is recommended that they see a doctor to be evaluated and treated.</p>
        <button class="collapsible">What premenstrual symptoms do people experience?</button>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>Before a person’s period starts each month, they may notice symptoms. These are known as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms.
            <br>
            While the media has been consistent in portraying food cravings and mood swings as the key symptoms of an upcoming period, women experience all sorts of symptoms including, but not limited to: cramps (this can range from mild to painful), acne breakouts, sore breasts, bloating, and diarrhea. Let’s break some of the most common symptoms down:
            <br>
            Food cravings
            In the weeks and days leading up to their period, an individual may crave especially sweet or starchy foods.
            <br>
            This is due to fluctuating hormone levels leading to an imbalance of estrogen and progesterone, which causes cravings. Furthermore, when we eat certain foods, our brain releases serotonin, which helps alleviate PMS symptoms.
            <br>
            Cramps 
            Cramps are caused by contractions of the uterus, which occur as it sheds its lining. They can easily be the most dramatic part of having a period, as they are the most painful. 
            <br>
            Cramps can happen at any time of a person’s cycle with differing levels of intensity and can also signal ovulation or come in the form of pre-menstrual cramps. Severe cramps or pelvic pain can also be a sign of a more serious condition like endometriosis.
            <br>
            Mood changes 
            Emotional symptoms are frequently experienced by people who deal with physical discomfort during their period.
            <br>
            Additionally, changes in hormones may cause mood swings. There is speculation that estrogen levels can correspond to levels serotonin, the neurotransmitter associated with our mood. As estrogen levels fluctuate during a person’s cycle, this can ultimately affect their emotional state.</p>

        <button class="collapsible">Can you get pregnant during your period?</button>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>Contrary to popular belief, it is possible for a woman to get pregnant if she has intercourse during her period. While it is unlikely, it is entirely possible. A woman with a short cycle can start ovulating a few days after her period, and sperm present from intercourse from up to five days earlier can still fertilize the egg. This is why contraceptives are still the best option for preventing unwanted pregnancy.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">How much does having a period cost?</button>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>Unfortunately, having a period can be expensive. All of the things needed to get through menstruation are not given away for free. That means people can end up spending large amounts of money on period products.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">I got my period and I haven't told my mom yet. It's really hard for me to talk about things like this. I have a lot of questions. What should I do?</button>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>Lots of girls have the same concern. Your mom will be one of your best resources when you have questions about your period, so try to start the conversation yourself! Know that she will be understanding and helpful. Actually, she may be your best friend during this time in your life. Still don’t feel like you can talk to your mom? An aunt, friend’s mom or older sister are also great women to ask.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">Will anyone, like boys or my mom, notice when I have my period?</button>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>No — not unless you tell them! If they ask you, it’s totally up to you to share or not.</p>
